## What you will learn
You will learn how to build a containerized microservices application that is based on the Java MicroProfile Kabanero Collection using Codewind
 for Eclipse Che running on OpenShift Container Plaftorm. 

## Prerequisites
1. You must have installed [Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.2](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/welcome/index.html).
1. You must have installed [Kabanero Foundation](https://kabanero.io/docs/ref/general/installing-kabanero-foundation.html)

## Getting started
Eclipse Codewind and Eclipse Che combine to simplify and enhance online development in containers, with features to write, debug, and deploy
 cloud-native applications. Eclipse Codewind provides the ability to create new projects based on Kabanero Collections that include Application 
 stacks customized to meet your company policies and consistently deploy applications and microservices at scale. 
 
 Kabanero installs on OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) and integrates a modern DevOps toolchain and Kabanero Collections which enable developers
  to use runtimes and frameworks in pre-built container images called `Application stacks`. Eclipse Codewind provides the ability to create application
   projects for these Application stacks and create projects based on a variety of different template types.

 In this guide, we will show you how you can install and configure Codewind for Eclipse Che on OCP and use Codewind to develop and deploy a simple 
  microservice application.

## Set up the Persistent Volume
If the cluster that you're installing Eclipse Che on does not use dynamic provisioning for storage (e.g. glusterfs), you must set up NFS volumes on the cluster.
 We recommend you set up a dynamic NFS persistent volume using the nfs-client from the kubernetes-incubator project as
 [documented in this guide](https://medium.com/faun/openshift-dynamic-nfs-persistent-volume-using-nfs-client-provisioner-fcbb8c9344e). This can be automated 
 as shwon in this example [NFS provisioner script](https://github.ibm.com/dacleyra/ocp-on-fyre/blob/master/nfs-storage-provisioner.sh).

## Enable Che in Kabanero
Once Kabanero is installed, there are two ways of enabling Che in the Kabanero Custom Resource Definiion

**Using the `oc` CLI**
1. Open a terminal and run the command: `oc edit kabanero -n kabanero -o yaml`
1. Set the `spec.che.enable` attribute to `true`
1. Save the file.

**Using the OpenShift Console**
1. Switch the project to `kabanero`
1. Under `Administration` click `Custom Resource Definitions`
1. Open the `kabanero` CRD and click on the `Instances` tab.
1. Open the `kabanero` name and click on the `YAML` tab.
1. Edit the `spec.che.enable` attribute to `true`
1. Click the `Save` button

After a short wait check the Kabanero custom resource (CR) by running this command:
```
oc get kabanero -n kabanero -o yaml
```
You should see from the status that Che is available and ready.
```yaml
status:
    appsody:
      ready: "True"
      version: 0.2.2
    che:
      cheOperator:
        version: 7.3.1
      kabaneroChe:
        version: 0.6.0
      kabaneroCheInstance:
        cheImage: kabanero/kabanero-che
        cheImageTag: 0.6.0
        cheWorkspaceClusterRole: eclipse-codewind
      ready: "True"
```

## Launch the Che dashboard through the OCP console.

1. Ensure that the Project is set to `kabanero`
1. Under `Networking` select the `Routes` menu item
1. The list of routes will include a new entry named `che`
1. Click on the link in the `Location` column to open the Che dashboard running in Kabanero. 
  * The default userid and password will be `admin` and `admin`.

![Che route location](/img/guide/eclipse-che-kabanero-ocp-kabanero-route-location.png)

The Kabanero Landing page will open in a new browser tab inviting you to create a new workspace. 
However, before proceeding Kabanero and Codewind need some extra configuration.

## Enabling privileged and root containers to run
In order to build container images Codewind is required to [run as privileged and as root](https://www.eclipse.org/codewind/mdt-che-installinfo.html#enabling-privileged-and-root-containers-to-run).
Enter the commands:

```
oc project kabanero
oc adm policy add-scc-to-group privileged system:serviceaccounts:kabanero
oc adm policy add-scc-to-group anyuid system:serviceaccounts:kabanero
```

## Adding the OpenShift internal registry with Codewind
Some of these instructions are adapted from [Adding the OpenShift internal registry with Codewind](https:www.eclipse.org/codewind/openshiftregistry.html).

**Setting up a service account**

In order to move container images in OpenShift you need to [create or identify a service account with sufficient access rights](https:www.eclipse.org/codewind/openshiftregistry.html#setting-up-a-service-account). Run the following commands:

```
oc new-project svt-che-proj1
oc create serviceaccount pusher
oc policy add-role-to-user system:image-builder system:serviceaccount:svt-che-proj1:pusher
oc describe sa pusher
oc describe secret pusher-token-5cl44
```

You will need the service account name and token value from the secret to add the OpenShift registry.  

**Adding the OpenShift registry in Che**

From the Kabanero Landing Page, under the `Administration` menu item click on the `Add Registry` button.

[Add the OpenShift registry in Che](https:www.eclipse.org/codewind/openshiftregistry.html#adding-the-openshift-registry-in-che) using the `pusher` service account set up previously and the token secret for the service account listed by the `oc describe secret` command. For OCP4.x use the registry address `image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000`

![Add the OpenShift registry in Che](/img/guide/eclipse-che-kabanero-ocp-add-openshift-registry-in-che.png)

## Create the Codewind workspace
Create the Codewind workspace using the latest CodeWind devfile. The general format for creating a Che workspace via a factory is `http://<che ingress domain>/f?url=<hosted devfile URL>`.
 Use the devfile `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/codewind-che-plugin/0.6.0/devfiles/0.6.0/devfile.yaml` with your Che ingress domain. 
 For example `http://che-kabanero.apps.scrunch.os.fyre.ibm.com/f?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/codewind-che-plugin/0.6.0/devfiles/0.6.0/devfile.yaml` 

**NOTE**
1. there is a known issue on Chrome where the [workspace initialization hangs](https:github.com/eclipse/che/issues/15188). We recommend that you use another web browser to complete this step, for exmaple Firefox.
1. You can only have one workspace running per devfile at a time now. You can have multiple workspaces, but the devfiles theyâ€™re based upon must be unique.

![Create the Codewind workspace](/img/guide/eclipse-che-kabanero-ocp-create-codewind-workspace.png)

When the installation completes make sure the Codewind workspace is running. For example, check that the Codewind persistent volume claim and replica set have been created:

```
oc project kabanero
oc get pv

## Add the OpenShift registry in Codewind
These instructions are based on the Codewind guide [Adding the OpenShift registry in Codewind](https://www.eclipse.org/codewind/openshiftregistry.html#adding-the-openshift-registry-in-codewind). 

On the right side of the Kabanero Landing Page click on the Codewind logo to open the Codewind project explorer. 
 Interacting with the project explorer will prompt you to set a deployment registry if you have not already done so.

![Check that Codewind is running in Che](/img/guide/eclipse-che-kabanero-ocp-check-codewind-running.png)

For OCP4.x enter `image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/<project name>` as the deployment registry. For example:

![Adding the OpenShift registry in Codewind](/img/guide/eclipse-che-kabanero-ocp-add-openshift-registry-in-codewind.png)

You will be asked if you want to deploy a test image to the registry. Click the `Yes` button to push the sample Hello World image

![Push the sample image](/img/guide/eclipse-che-kabanero-ocp-push-sample-image.png)

You will see a confirmation message that the test has succeeded and the deployment registry saved

![Deployment registry test succeeded](/img/guide/eclipse-che-kabanero-ocp-save-registry-success-msg.png)

## Add Kabanero stack to Codewind
Open the Codewind project explorer by clicking on the Codewind logo on the right side of the workspace.
Right click on `Projects > Manage Template Sources`. 

![Manage teamplate sources](/img/guide/eclipse-che-kabanero-ocp-manage-template-sources.png)

Click on the `Add New` button to create a new template.
Enter the Kabanero 0.3.0 collection `https:github.com/kabanero-io/collections/releases/download/0.3.0/kabanero-index.json`, then give it a name and description.

![Add the Kabanero template source](/img/guide/eclipse-che-kabanero-ocp-add-kabanero-template-source.png)

Enable only the Kabanero stack and disable others.

![Enable only the Kabanero template collection](/img/guide/eclipse-che-kabanero-ocp-enable-only-kabanero-template.png)

## Create a microservices application 
From the Codewind project explorer click on the `+` sign next to Projects to create a new project with the Kabanero 0.3.0 collection.
 Select the `Kabanero Eclipse MicroProfile` template and enter a name for your app. 

![Kabanero select template](/img/guide/eclipse-che-kabanero-ocp-select-template.png)

Your new project is created, built, and compiled inside a container. 
The project overview will show that the build was successful and that the application had started.
To view the project logs, right click on the your project name, and select `Show all logs`. An `Output` tab
is displayed containing the project's build logs.

![Kabanero project status](/img/guide/eclipse-che-kabanero-ocp-kabanero-project-status.png)

Launch the application by clicking on the Application Endpoint. This opens a new browser window showing 
the Welcome to your Appsody Microservice page.

![Eclipse MicroProfile sample application](/img/guide/eclipse-che-kabanero-ocp-mp-app.png)

Make a change in the app and see that it's updated.

You can view the application pod's in the `kabanero` namespace. The pod's name starts with `cw-`.
For example:

```
# oc get pods  -n kabanero | grep cw-
cw-javampapp-607e7be0-0bf0-11ea-823b-7867f86f7c-zdfcc             1/1     Running   0          103m

# oc get routes -n kabanero | grep cw-
cw-javampapp-607e7be0-0bf0-11ea-823b-service-74tg4          cw-javampapp-607e7be0-che-kabanero.apps.scrunch.os.fyre.ibm.com                /      cw-javampapp-607e7be0-0bf0-11ea-823b-service          9080                                  None
```

View the deployment:
```
